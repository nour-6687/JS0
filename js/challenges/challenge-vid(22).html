    explain: post increment makes a equals 11 but not be printed

    explain: ++ are pre increment that adds  1 before the operation 

    [+] addition operator

    [-b]
    value= -20
    explain: - is a unary operator that negates the b string but it gives a number

    explain : [++] are post increment the value after operation is 13 but not used

    [+] addition operator

    [+a]
    value = 13
    explain: because it was operated previously as 13 

    total value = 11 + 20 + 80 - 12 + 13 = 71

    [+] addition operator

    value = 20 
    as number because of [+] unary that converts string to number vv

    explain: post increment makes its value to 21 but not used
    [-] subtraction operator
    [+b]
    value= -21 
    explain: as it was 21 from the previous operation but negated because of [-]
